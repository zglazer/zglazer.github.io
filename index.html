          <h1><a name="about"></a>About Me</h1>
          <p>
          	I am currently a student at UW-Madison studying computer science. I have had a long interest in computers but have
          	only recently started to pursue software development as a career. I have a BS in biochemistry from UW-Madison and 
          	now I am back again to study computer science. 
          </p>
          <p>
          	I received my BS in biochemistry in December 2010 and soon after accepted 
          	a position at Epic Systems Corporation in Madison, WI. After 2 years of work I decided I wanted to further my education in 
          	computer sciences. In December 2013 I was awarded a certificate in computer sciences from UW-Madison. 
          	I am now taking more classes at UW-Madison while preparing to apply for a Masters program.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Languages: Java, Python, C++, C</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Interests: Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interaction </strong></p>
          <h1><a name="project"></a>Project List</h4>
          <p class="lead">
          	Most of my projects and contributions are listed on my <a href="http://github.com/zglazer"> GitHub page</a>. However,
          	some of my school projects and current projects are highlighted below.
          </p>

          <h4> <a href="https://github.com/zglazer/instapaper">Instapaper.c</a> - an Instapaper library written in C </h4>
          <p>
          	This was a project I thought would be a fun introduction to working with APIs. Instapaper offers a very simple
          	API with a low barrier to entry that allowed me to quickly code and test a command line application.
          </p>
          <p><strong> Skills: C </strong></p>
        

          <h4> <a href="https://github.com/zglazer/Tic-Tac-Toe"> Tic-Tac-Toe.py </a> - a GUI tic-tac-toe implementation written in Python. </h4>
          <p>
          	This was my first project I have ever made with any form of GUI and also my first Python program. 
          	I plan on making more simple Python GUI games as practice. GUI written using Tkinter. 
          </p>
          <p><strong> Skills: Python, Tkinter </strong></p>

          <h4> <a href="https://github.com/zglazer/Projects"> Projects </a> - a list of various projects in serveral different languages and areas. </h4>
          <p>
            Projects were mostly taken from <a href="https://github.com/karan/Projects"> this list</a> of projects on GitHub. Each program is small
            and is meant to help improve my fluency in a paticular programming language. Types of projects range from string maniupation to data structures and
            algorithms. 
          </p>
          <p><strong> Skills: Varied </strong></p>
